SUMMARY 1
The code is to collected a list of 3 resistor values and calculate the parallel resistance and print its output 

REASON 1
Code was written for lab 1 for ECSE3038 course. 

JOKE
I'm not a hard drinker, I actually find it pretty easy

SUMMARY 2
The code is to take the voltage supplied and the resistor values in series. The total resistance is calculated to find the current which allows for the current to be used to solve for the voltage drop across each individual resistor in the list and is then printed.  

REASON 2
Code was written for lab 1 for ECSE3038 course. 

JOKE
I told a chemistry joke once, didnt get much of a reaction

SUMMARY 3
The code is to take body temperature input and the unit of measurement. If certain parameters are met it should distinguish the patients current state of health. 

REASON 3
Code was written for lab 1 for ECSE3038 course.

JOKE 
Have you ever been camping, it's in tents.
