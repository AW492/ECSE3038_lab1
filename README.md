SUMMARY 2
The code is to take the voltage supplied and the resistor values in series. The total resistance is calculated to find the current which allows for the current to be used to solve for the voltage drop across each individual resistor in the list and is then printed.  

REASON 2
Code was written for lab 1 for ECSE3038 course. 

JOKE
I told a chemistry joke once, didnt get much of a reaction
